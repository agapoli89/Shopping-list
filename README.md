# Shopping-list
Simple application created to help you to do smart shopping.

## Technologies
HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT.

It is my first application based on Object-oriented programming. I was also trying to use the rules of BEM. 
To make shopping list more useful for users, there is an option to save selected products in Local Storage.

### Status: in progress
I am planing to add:
1. Suggestions class
2. category and amount of products
